# PROJECT : E-Commerce-Return-Rate-Reduction-Analysis

# Overview
This project analyzes the Olist Brazilian E-Commerce dataset to identify why customers return products and how return rates vary across categories, geography, and payment channels.
The analysis combines Python, SQL, and Power BI to generate insights, build a predictive model (logistic regression), and  an interactive dashboard for business users.

# Objectives

1.Cleaned and prepare raw e-commerce data
2.Analyze return rates by category, state, and payment method
3.Build a logistic regression model to predict return probability
4.Create an interactive Power BI dashboard with drill-through filters

# Tech

-Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
-SQL (SQLite inside Python)
-Power BI for dashboarding

# Deliverables

- Python notebook with analysis and model
- SQL queries inside notebook
- Power BI dashboard
- CSV archive folder of the dataset used

# Key Insights

-Logistic and product quality issues drive most returns
-Certain categories (electronics, office) have higher return %
-Some states consistently show higher returns â†’ logistics optimization needed
-Delivery delays strongly correlated with returns
